    r"""Expectation of product of one-body operators w.r.t. a Slater determinant.

    A one-body operator :math:`O` has the form

    .. math::

        O = \sum_{pq} M_{pq} a_p^\dagger a_q.

    This function takes a list of the matrices :math:`M` as its first argument.
    Let :math:`(O_1, O_2, \dots O_k)` be the list of one-body operators,
    and :math:`\lvert \psi \rangle` be the Slater determinant.

    Note: Unlike most functions in ffsim, the inputs to this function are specified
        in terms of spin-orbitals, not spatial orbitals. In other words, the one-rdm
        and the one-body tensors should have the same shape, and all orbitals are
        treated on an equal footing. The 1-RDM passed here should not be spin-summed,
        and the one-body tensors should be expanded when compared to the usual
        one-body tensors elsewhere in ffsim, i.e.,
        `scipy.linalg.block_diag(one_body_tensor, one_body_tensor)`.

    Args:
        one_rdm: The one-body reduced density matrix of the Slater determinant.
