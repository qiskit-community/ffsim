# ffsim

<!-- start introduction -->

ffsim is a software library for simulating fermionic quantum circuits that conserve particle number and the Z component of spin. This category includes many quantum circuits used for quantum chemistry simulations. By exploiting the symmetries and using specialized algorithms, ffsim can simulate these circuits much faster than a generic quantum circuit simulator.

**Experimental disclaimer**: ffsim is currently an experimental release. Breaking changes may be introduced without warning.

## Documentation

Documentation is located at the [project website](https://qiskit-community.github.io/ffsim/).

## Installation

<!-- start installation -->

We recommend installing ffsim using pip, when possible:

```bash
pip install ffsim
```

This method won't work natively on Windows, however. Refer to the [installation instructions](https://qiskit-community.github.io/ffsim/install.html) for information about using ffsim on Windows, as well as instructions for installing from source and running ffsim in a container.

<!-- end installation -->
