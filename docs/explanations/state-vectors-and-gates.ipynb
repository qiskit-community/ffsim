    "In ffsim, state vectors are represented as plain one-dimensional NumPy arrays. The length of a state vector is determined by the number of orbitals in the system and their occupancies. The number of $\\alpha$ (spin up) electrons and the number of $\\beta$ (spin down) electrons are each assumed to be fixed. For a system with $N$ spatial orbitals, $N_\\alpha$ electrons with spin $\\alpha$, and $N_\\beta$ electrons with spin $\\beta$, the state vector has length\n",

    "Each entry of the state vector is associated with an electronic configuration, which can be labeled by the concatenation of two bitstrings, $\\lvert s_\\beta s_\\alpha \\rangle$, where $s_\\alpha$ is a bitstring of length $N$ with Hamming weight $N_\\alpha$, and $s_\\beta$ is a bitstring of length $N$ with Hamming weight $N_\\beta$. A full specification of the state vector representation requires a choice of ordering for the bitstrings. ffsim uses the same ordering as [PySCF](https://pyscf.org/)'s FCI module, `pyscf.fci`. You can use the `addresses_to_strings` function in ffsim to convert a list of state vector indices to the corresponding bitstrings."
