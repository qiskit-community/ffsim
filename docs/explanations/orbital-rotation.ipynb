    "## Orbital rotations\n",
    "\n",
    "The orbital rotation is a fundamental operation in the simulation of a system of fermionic modes. An orbital rotation is described by an $N \\times N$ unitary matrix $\\mathbf{U}$ (here $N$ is the number spatial orbitals), and we denote the corresponding operator as $\\mathcal{U}$. This operator has the following action on the fermionic creation operators $\\set{a^\\dagger_{\\sigma, i}}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\mathcal{U} a^\\dagger_{\\sigma, i} \\mathcal{U}^\\dagger = \\sum_j \\mathbf{U}_{ji} a^\\dagger_{\\sigma, j}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, $a^\\dagger_{\\sigma, i}$ is mapped to a new operator $b^\\dagger_{\\sigma, i}$ where $b^\\dagger_{\\sigma, i}$ is a linear combination of the operators $\\set{a^\\dagger_{\\sigma, i}}$ with coefficients given by the $i$-th column of $\\mathbf{U}$. The $\\set{b^\\dagger_{\\sigma, i}}$ also satisfy the fermionic anticommutation relations, so they are creation operators in a rotated basis. The mapping $\\mathbf{U} \\mapsto \\mathcal{U}$ satisfies the properties\n",

The $\\set{\\lambda_i}$ and the unitary matrix $\\mathbf{U}$ describing the orbital rotation are obtained from an eigendecomposition of $\\mathbf{M}$:\n",

    "ffsim already includes a function called [apply_num_op_sum_evolution](../api/ffsim.rst#ffsim.apply_num_op_sum_evolution) for performing this operation, but it accepts the orbital energies and rotation as arguments rather than the matrix $M$. The reason for this design is that many applications involve applying time evolution by the same Hamiltonian repeatedly as part of a subroutine. Since the orbital energies and rotation are the same every time, they should be computed only once at the beginning, and then passed to the function that applies the time evolution."
