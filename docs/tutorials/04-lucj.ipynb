In order that the operator commutes with the total spin operator, we enforce that $\\mathbf{J}^{\\alpha\\alpha} = \\mathbf{J}^{\\beta\\beta}$ and $\\mathbf{J}^{\\alpha\\beta} = \\mathbf{J}^{\\beta\\alpha}$. As a result, we have two sets of matrices for describing the diagonal Coulomb operators: \"alpha-alpha\" matrices containing coefficients for terms involving the same spin, and \"alpha-beta\" matrices containing coefficients for terms involving different spins.\n",

A constructor method is provided to initialize the operator from a truncated double factorization of t2 amplitudes (e.g. from CCSD or MP2).\n",

For our reference state, we'll use the Hartree-Fock state. We use the function `apply_ucj_operator` to apply the ansatz operator to the reference state to obtain the ansatz state. Finally, we compute the energy of the ansatz state."

    "Implementing the $e^{i \\mathcal{J}_k}$ term of the UCJ ansatz requires either all-to-all connectivity or the use of a fermionic swap network, making it challenging for noisy pre-fault-tolerant quantum processors that have limited connectivity. The idea of the *local* UCJ ansatz is to impose sparsity constraints on the $\\mathbf{J}^{\\alpha\\alpha}$ and $\\mathbf{J}^{\\alpha\\beta}$ matrices which allow them to be implemented in constant depth on qubit topologies with limited connectivity. The constraints are specified by a list of indices indicating which matrix entries in the upper triangle are allowed to be nonzero (since the matrices are symmetric, only the upper triangle needs to be specified).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider a square lattice qubit topology. We can place the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ orbitals in parallel lines on the lattice, with connections between these lines forming \"rungs\" of a ladder shape. With this setup, orbitals with the same spin are connected with a line topology, while orbitals with different spins are connected when they share the same spatial orbital. This yields the following index constraints on the $\\mathbf{J}$ matrices:\n",

    "In other words, if the $\\mathbf{J}$ matrices are nonzero only at the specified indices in the upper triangle, then the $e^{i \\mathcal{J}_k}$ term can be implemented on a square topology without using any swap gates, in constant depth. Of course, imposing such constraints on the ansatz makes it less expressive, so more ansatz repetitions may be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code cell, we demonstrate the optimization of the ansatz with these constraints imposed. We still choose to use 2 repetitions, so notice that the number of parameters in the optimization has decreased from 20 to 14. In this simple example, we are still able to recover the ground state energy exactly."
