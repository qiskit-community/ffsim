    "# Introduction to ffsim\n",
    "\n",
    "ffsim is a software library for simulating fermionic quantum circuits that conserve particle number and the Z component of spin. By taking advantage of these symmetries, it can simulate these circuits much more efficiently than a generic quantum circuit simulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary way of using ffsim is by calling functions that transform statevectors represented directly as NumPy arrays. As an example, the following code shows how to create a vector representing the Hartree-Fock state with 6 spatial orbitals, 3 alpha electrons and 2 beta electrons, and then apply an orbital rotation to it. It also shows an equivalent way to construct the resulting state as a Slater determinant."
