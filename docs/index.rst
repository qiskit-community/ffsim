Welcome to ffsim's documentation!
=================================

ffsim is a software library for simulating fermionic quantum circuits that conserve particle number
and the Z component of spin. This category includes many quantum circuits used for quantum chemistry simulations.
By exploiting the symmetries and using specialized algorithms, ffsim can simulate these circuits much faster
than a generic quantum circuit simulator.
